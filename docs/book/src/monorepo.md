## Affected detection

In a large repo you don't want to run everything on every change. `yatr affected
<git-ref>` lists the tasks touched by changes since a ref — a task is affected
when one of its `sources`/`watch` globs matches a changed file, and the result
propagates to everything that (transitively) depends on it.

```bash
yatr affected main                     # what would I need to run for this branch?
yatr affected HEAD~1 --format json     # machine-readable, for CI
yatr run --affected origin/main test lint build   # run only the affected ones
```

Caching gives you *correctness* (unchanged tasks are cache hits); affected
detection adds *speed at scale* by not even considering tasks git says can't have
moved. A task that declares no `sources` is treated as always affected — declaring
`sources` is what unlocks skipping.

## Splitting config across files

Keep task definitions next to the code they build and compose them from a root
`yatr.toml` with `include`:

```toml
# yatr.toml
include = ["frontend/yatr.toml", "backend/yatr.toml"]

[tasks.build-all]
depends = ["fe-build", "be-build"]   # tasks defined in the included files
```

Includes are resolved relative to the including file and merged recursively
(cycles are detected). Tasks and `env` are composed; the root file's `settings`
are authoritative. A task defined in two files is an error — names are global.

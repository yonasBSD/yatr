# yatr 🦬

Yet another task runner. But this one's actually good.

```
yatr test          # Run tests
yatr build         # Build with dependencies
yatr --watch test  # Re-run on file changes
```

A fast, single-binary, polyglot task runner with a cache that actually tells the
truth: content-addressed, output-restoring, and shareable across machines and CI.

## Why yatr?

| Feature | Make | Just | cargo-make | **yatr** |
|---------|------|------|------------|------------|
| Simple config | ❌ | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ |
| Parallel execution | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Content-addressed caching | ❌ | ❌ | ⚠️ | ✅ |
| Captures & restores outputs | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Remote / shared cache | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Signed cache (anti-poisoning) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Watch mode | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Config schema + JSON output | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Sandboxed WASM plugins | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Scripting | Shell | Shell | Multiple | Rhai |
| Cross-platform | ❌ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Zero runtime deps | N/A | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |

yatr sits in the sweet spot: **simpler than cargo-make**, **more powerful than just**.

**Fast, too:** ~8 ms startup (beats `make`, matches `just`), and a content-addressed
cache that makes warm rebuilds ~14× faster than a runner with no caching. See
[`benches/`](benches/) — reproduce the numbers with `benches/bench.sh`.

## Installation

```bash
cargo install yatr
```

Or from source (latest `main`):

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/cargopete/yatr
```

## Quick Start

Create a `yatr.toml` in your project root:

```toml
[tasks.test]
desc = "Run tests"
run = ["cargo test"]

[tasks.build]
desc = "Build release"
depends = ["test"]
run = ["cargo build --release"]
```

Run tasks:

```bash
yatr test          # Run tests
yatr build         # Runs test first, then build
yatr run test build  # Run multiple tasks
yatr --dry-run build # Show execution plan
```

## Configuration

### Basic Tasks

```toml
[tasks.fmt]
desc = "Format code"
run = ["cargo fmt", "cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty"]
```

### Task Dependencies

```toml
[tasks.check]
desc = "Full check pipeline"
depends = ["fmt", "lint", "test"]
run = []  # Just runs dependencies
```

### Parallel Execution

```toml
[tasks.lint]
desc = "Run all linters"
parallel = true
run = [
    "cargo fmt --check",
    "cargo clippy -- -D warnings",
    "cargo doc --no-deps"
]
```

### Environment Variables

```toml
[env]
RUST_LOG = "debug"
DATABASE_URL = "postgres://localhost/test"

[tasks.test]
env = { RUST_BACKTRACE = "1" }
run = ["cargo test"]
```

### Rhai Scripting

For complex logic, use inline Rhai scripts:

```toml
[tasks.bump-version]
desc = "Bump patch version"
script = '''
    let cargo = read_file("Cargo.toml");
    let toml = parse_toml(cargo);
    let version = toml["package"]["version"];
    let new_version = semver_bump(version, "patch");
    
    print(`Bumping ${version} -> ${new_version}`);
    
    let updated = cargo.replace(version, new_version);
    write_file("Cargo.toml", updated);
'''
```

Available Rhai functions:

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `read_file(path)` | Read file contents |
| `write_file(path, content)` | Write file |
| `file_exists(path)` | Check if file exists |
| `exec(cmd)` | Run shell command |
| `glob(pattern)` | Find files matching pattern |
| `parse_json(str)` | Parse JSON string |
| `parse_toml(str)` | Parse TOML string |
| `semver_bump(ver, part)` | Bump version (major/minor/patch) |
| `get_env(key)` | Get environment variable |

### Caching

Tasks are cached by default based on:
- Task configuration (commands, env vars)
- Source file contents (if `sources` specified)

```toml
[tasks.build]
run = ["cargo build --release"]
sources = ["src/**/*.rs", "Cargo.toml", "Cargo.lock"]
outputs = ["target/release/myapp"]
```

Disable caching:

```toml
[tasks.deploy]
no_cache = true
run = ["./deploy.sh"]
```

### Watch Mode

Re-run tasks when files change:

```bash
yatr watch test
```

Configure watch patterns:

```toml
[tasks.test]
run = ["cargo test"]
watch = ["src/**/*.rs", "tests/**/*.rs"]
```

### Shell Mode

By default, commands run without a shell (cross-platform safe). Enable shell for pipes, redirects, etc:

```toml
[tasks.lines]
shell = true
run = ["find src -name '*.rs' | wc -l"]
```

Or per-invocation:

```bash
yatr --shell run lines
```

yatr run --affected origin/main ci # Run only the affected subset of the requested tasks
```

## Affected detection (monorepo)

In a large repo you don't want to run everything on every change. `yatr affected
<git-ref>` lists the tasks touched by changes since a ref — a task is affected
when one of its `sources`/`watch` globs matches a changed file, and the result
propagates to everything that (transitively) depends on it.

```bash
yatr affected main                  # what would I need to run for this branch?
yatr affected HEAD~1 --format json  # machine-readable, for CI
yatr run --affected origin/main test lint build   # run only the affected ones
```

Caching already gives you *correctness* (unchanged tasks are cache hits); affected
detection adds *speed at scale* by not even considering tasks git says can't have
moved. A task that declares no `sources` is treated as always affected — declaring
`sources` is what unlocks skipping.

## WASM plugins

A task can be implemented by a WebAssembly plugin instead of shell commands or a
Rhai script — write it in any language that compiles to `wasm32`, ship a single
`.wasm`, and run it anywhere yatr runs:

```toml
[tasks.codegen]
desc = "Run a sandboxed WASM plugin"
wasm = "plugins/codegen.wasm"   # local path, relative to the task's working directory

[tasks.shared]
wasm = "https://example.com/releases/v1/plugin.wasm"   # an http(s) URL

[tasks.gh]
wasm = "github:owner/repo@v1.0.0/plugin.wasm"          # …or a GitHub release asset
```

A `wasm` reference may be a local path, an `http(s)://` **URL**, or a
`github:owner/repo@tag/asset.wasm` shorthand (resolved to that release asset).
Remote plugins are downloaded once into a local plugin cache and reused (override
the cache dir with `YATR_PLUGIN_DIR`). Use a versioned ref so a new release is
picked up. Because plugins run sandboxed, even an untrusted remote plugin can't
escape.

Plugins are **capability-sandboxed**: they run in a pure-Rust interpreter with
*only* yatr's host ABI imported — no filesystem, network, or clock unless yatr
grants it. A plugin that tries to import anything else (e.g. WASI) fails to load.

A plugin is a wasm module that exports its `memory` and a `run() -> i32` entry
point (`0` = success), and may import these host functions from module `"yatr"`:

| Import | Signature | Effect |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| `emit` | `(ptr: i32, len: i32)` | Append the UTF-8 string at that memory range to the task's output |
| `log`  | `(ptr: i32, len: i32)` | Log the string as an info message |
| `input_len` | `() -> i32` | Byte length of this task's input |
| `input_read` | `(ptr: i32) -> i32` | Copy the input bytes into memory at `ptr`; returns bytes written |

The plugin receives its task name and environment as JSON input
(`{ "task": ..., "env": { ... } }`) — read it with `input_len` + `input_read`,
so a single plugin can be parameterised per task. Plugin output is captured and
cached like any other task. (The runtime also accepts `.wat` text, handy for
quick experiments.)

### Writing plugins in Rust

You don't have to hand-roll the memory ABI — the [`yatr-plugin`](crates/yatr-plugin)
crate wraps it so you write plain Rust:

```rust
yatr_plugin::plugin!({
    let input = yatr_plugin::input_string();  // {"task":...,"env":{...}}
    yatr_plugin::emit(&format!("hello from a plugin; input = {input}"));
    Ok(())
});
```

```bash
cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Then point a task at the resulting `.wasm`. See the crate's README for the full API.

## Toolchains (no more "works on my machine")

Pin a language runtime and yatr downloads it once and puts it on the task `PATH` —
a fresh checkout runs green with no manual installs:

```toml
[toolchain.node]
version = "20.11.0"
url = "https://nodejs.org/dist/v{version}/node-v{version}-{os}-{arch}.tar.gz"
bin = "node-v{version}-{os}-{arch}/bin"

[tasks.build]
run = ["node build.js"]   # uses the pinned node, wherever yatr runs
```

`{version}`, `{os}` (`linux`/`darwin`/`win`) and `{arch}` (`x64`/`arm64`) are
substituted into the templates. Toolchains are cached under a local toolchains dir
(override with `YATR_TOOLCHAIN_DIR`) and installed once. `.tar.gz` archives are
supported today (zip is on the roadmap).

## Splitting config across files

Large repos can keep task definitions next to the code they build and compose
them from a root `yatr.toml` with `include`:

```toml
# yatr.toml
include = ["frontend/yatr.toml", "backend/yatr.toml"]

[tasks.build-all]
depends = ["fe-build", "be-build"]   # tasks defined in the included files
```

Includes are resolved relative to the including file and merged recursively
(cycles are detected). Tasks and `env` are composed; the root file's `settings`
are authoritative. A task defined in two files is an error — names are global.

## Shared (remote) cache

Point yatr at a shared HTTP cache and a task built on one machine (or in CI) is
restored on the next, instead of rebuilt. It speaks a small REST protocol —
`GET`/`PUT`/`HEAD` on `<url>/ac/<key>` (action results) and `<url>/cas/<blob>`
(content blobs) — the same path layout as Bazel's HTTP cache, so it works
against an off-the-shelf blob store or a tiny server.

```toml
[settings.remote_cache]
url = "https://cache.example.com/yatr"
token_env = "YATR_CACHE_TOKEN"   # optional; bearer token read from this env var
sign_key_env = "YATR_CACHE_KEY"  # optional; shared secret for signing (see below)
read = true                      # pull from the remote on a local miss (default: true)
write = true                     # push after a successful run (default: true)
```

The cache is **content-addressed and machine-portable**: identical inputs produce
identical keys regardless of checkout path. A flaky or unreachable remote is
non-fatal — yatr logs a warning and runs the task locally. Keep secrets out of
the committed config by using the `*_env` options rather than inline values.

**Integrity & signing.** Cached output blobs are verified against their content
digests on download, so a tampered blob is rejected automatically. For defence
against a compromised cache poisoning *action results*, set `sign_key_env` to a
shared secret: yatr signs each action result with a keyed BLAKE3 MAC and rejects
any entry whose signature doesn't verify under your key.

## Editor integration

yatr ships a JSON Schema for `yatr.toml`, giving you autocomplete, hover docs,
and validation in any editor that supports schema-validated TOML.

```bash
yatr schema > yatr.schema.json   # regenerate the schema any time
```

Point your editor at it. With taplo / the **Even Better TOML** VS Code extension,
add a directive to the top of your `yatr.toml`:

```toml
#:schema ./yatr.schema.json
```

or associate it globally in VS Code settings:

```json
"evenBetterToml.schema.associations": { "yatr\\.toml$": "./yatr.schema.json" }
```

## Showcases

Real-world projects using yatr in production:

### Boutique Bouquet - Full-Stack E-Commerce Platform

**Stack**: Rust (Axum) backend + Next.js frontend + PostgreSQL + Docker

[Boutique Bouquet](https://github.com/cargopete/boutique-bouquet) is an e-commerce platform that uses yatr to orchestrate its entire development workflow across multiple languages and services.

**Key workflows enabled by yatr:**

- **Unified development experience**: Single command (`yatr dev-local`) starts PostgreSQL in Docker, Rust backend, and Next.js frontend simultaneously
- **Language-agnostic orchestration**: Manages Rust cargo commands, npm scripts, and Docker operations from one config
- **Comprehensive CI pipeline**: `yatr ci` runs formatting, linting, type-checking, tests, and builds across both backend and frontend
- **Flexible deployment targets**: Separate tasks for Docker-based and local development workflows

**Example task configuration:**

```toml
[tasks.dev-local]
desc = "Start DB in Docker, backend and frontend locally (parallel)"
run = ["sh", "-c", "docker-compose up -d postgres && (cd backend && cargo run) & (cd frontend && npm run dev) & wait"]

[tasks.ci]
desc = "Run full CI pipeline (checks + tests + build)"
depends = ["check", "test", "build"]

[tasks.test]
desc = "Run all tests (backend + frontend)"
depends = ["backend-test", "frontend-test"]
```

**Results**:
- Reduced onboarding time - new developers run `yatr dev-local` instead of memorizing 5+ commands
- Consistent CI/CD - same task definitions work locally and in CI
- 40+ tasks managing everything from database migrations to production builds
